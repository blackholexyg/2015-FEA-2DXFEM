main.m is the program entrance point. It contains two parts: first part is for mesh processing and second part is the solver, which builds the matrices (K,f) and solve u=K\f.

### How to see results

Two vtk files will be generated and they can be rendered using [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)
